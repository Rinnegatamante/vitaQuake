# CDAudio Support

vitaQuake supports all soundtrack packs for Quake and its two official mission packs, "Scourge of Armagon" and "Dissolution of Eternity." In order for the soundtrack to work, files must be placed in a folder named /cdtracks/ in each campaign folder (main game for example will be ux0:data/Quake/id1/cdtracks). 

By default, the music folder has tracks named as track02, track03, etc. For vitaQuake, add an extra "0" after "track" in order for them to be loaded properly and in order. **Ex.: track02 -> track002**

You can find the official soundtrack for the main campaign in .ogg format [here](https://www.quaddicted.com/files/music/quake_music.zip).

# Loading Expansions and Mods

vitaQuake supports the official Quake expansions, "Scourge of Armagon" and "Dissolution of Eternity." These were offical expansions, so they can be found usually wherever the full base game is sold (GOG, Steam). In order to get them to load properly, place them in the "ux0:/data/quake/" folder alongside "id1". 

Both official mission packs support their own soundtracks as long as they are placed properly in their respective "/cdtracks/" folder.

Mod compatibility is varied, but as a general rule of thumb, mods compatible with winQuake will be compatible with vitaQuake.

Here's a list of some popular mods and their actual working state:
